# slate-auto-exit-block

Let's say you are working on a Word Document.

You are using an ordered list. When you hit 'Enter' twice, the editor clears the last list line and add a new paragraph. That's what this plugin does.

# Blocks

## H1-H6

Insert a new paragrah on simple Enter.

## Blockquote, UL and OL

Insert a new paragraph on a double Enter if the last block is empty. Also removes this last block.

# TO-DO

- Make it work for tables and other elements.
